This project is an attempt at recreating the Google homepage, completed on 9/20/2020. 

I learned how important it is to organize sections in order to add CSS in a more seamless way to HTML. This ensures that any issues that occur can be easily found and corrected. By working through with reference material I was able to gain more understanding on how things operate in regards to one another. It helped me realize I learn better through application and guidance rather than trying to wing it. 

I demonstrated how to inline block the navigation and footer, alter the buttons and form/search bar, and rearrange content to closely replicate the actual Google homepage. While its not a 1 for 1 replica, given my beginner skillset, I'm satisfied and will revisit this project in the future once I have more experience.
